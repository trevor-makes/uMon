# uMon

**Deprecated! Merged into [core](https://github.com/trevor-makes/core)**

uMon is a collection of primitives useful in developing a machine language monitor for hobby computers based around an Arduino microcontroller.

This package is intended to be used with [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/), but the source files can be manually copied into a project when using the Arduino IDE.

To add uMon to an existing PlatformIO project, modify the `platformio.ini` configuration file as follows:

```
lib_deps =
    https://github.com/trevor-makes/uMon.git
```

uMon is distributed under the [MIT license](LICENSE.txt)
